I was inspired by the scene in Ratatouille when Remy is tasting cheese and fruits and when he puts them together. This led me to think about the emotion of ecstacy (happiness and pleasure combined) that remy was feeling and I tried to mimic that. Pink and yellow seem like very bright and happy colors that could mimic this feeling. In the dynamic configuration, when the button is down, it was intended to mimic the firework pops present in the Ratatouille scene.
