**Introduction**

This is my version of Mastermind. I loved this game when I was a kid. Since the game requires the clicking imput to play, I did not want to make it too confusing. Therefore, there are two programs to send to 3 blinks each.

**RULES**

On the mystery blinks, ideally someone else, will click once to cycle through preset colors. Once you are satisfied, double click to hide the color. If the color must be changed, hold down until the entire blink turns white and then continue to cycle through the colors. When the mystery blinks are double clicked a white light will appear on one segment. Position this light outwards so that one blink can be attatched to it.

On the guessing blinks, click to cycle through the colors that will appear on one light. Then connect this light to the white light on the mystery blinks. The mystery blinks will inform you whether you are correct or not. Try to get the secret code in as few tries as possible!


**PROCESS**

I ran through so many ideas to get onto this one. There were a lot of things that happen behind the scenes that were hard to get down in order for the game to run properly. For example, in the off chance that the mystery blinks were arranged in a way to which the white lights were connected to another mystery blink, it would flash red. However, through a lot of experimentation, I eventually figured it out.

Some features I would add would be to have a limited number of guesses. This just transitions to a luck game rather than a guessing game however, so I am not 100% sold on the idea. Another idea would be to make the game have a singlep player mode. In order to display a color, I used a digit that corresponded to a certain color. However, when I tried to randomize said digit, it would not work. Maybe we can fix this.
