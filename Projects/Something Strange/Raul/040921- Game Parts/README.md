## Restore brightness

This is one of the key tradeoffs in my game since the game is all about building out and exploring or maintaining. Simply click to restore the brightness. For the class: Is the pace too slow or too fast? I also personally like this tradeoff but what is your opinion on it?

## Recognize Shape

Oh my this was difficult to program! There were just a lot of things I needed to take into account and I also needed to wrestle with a bunch of different blinks mechanics that I was not aware of. What this program does is turn green when any blink has 5 connections. Since the game is meant to be played with 6 blinks, the shape turns out to be a broken hexagon. 

## Switch Color

Note: As of 040821, switch color is not in the repo, it will be updated soon.

The purpose of this program is to switch the color of the cluster when one blink is connected in a new place.
