# Project 2 - GEHT!

Principle: 
- Core Mechanic: Movement and exploration

- Number of Players: 1+
- Number of Blinks: 2
- Time to play: 1-5 minutes

### Description

## Game Instructions
1. You cannot go backwards (if the commpass points 180 degree backwards, click again.) Only 5/6 faces require movement. 
2. 1 click of compass = 1 step. 2 clicks = 2 steps. 
3. Try to reach the target blinks. When you do, connect the compass to the target. 
4. If you run into something you have to start over. 

### Setup
1. Begin with 2 blinks not connected.
2. Triple click one of the blinks to designate it as the target. 
3. Place the target blink somewhere across the space if you are solo, or, designate someone to place the target blink somewhere. PLACE THIS BLINK VERTICALLY.

4. Double click a single blink to activate its compass property. 
5. Now, either single or double click the blink to determine which directioon to take a step in. 1 click = 1 step. 2 clicks = 2 steps. (DOUBLE CLICK NOT WORKING RN)

### Gameplay
1. Click or double click your blink and try to get to the target blink in as little time as possible. 

### Win Condition
The game is over when you reach the target blink and connect it to your compass. 

## Process
- Inspiration
Red Light Green Light. Journey. Trying to use blinks to capture a movement game. 

- Design Process
Started knowing I wanted to do something with movement. Thought of red light green light in my sleep and thought that would be a good concept to explore. This game can be played solo and have the player select how many steps they want to take however. 
Opted for a random direction each click because the RNG element adds uncertainty and excitement to every click. 

- Learning, Questions, Notes

How can I seperate out a single or double click? I tried with an ||, but what happens if you double click is it does two single clicks then a double click, So 3 directions show up.

I still need to add more attractive graphics for the target and the win condition.
