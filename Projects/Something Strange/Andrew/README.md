# Project 2 - GEHT!

Principle: 
- Core Mechanic: Movement and exploration

- Number of Players: 1+
- Number of Blinks: 3-5
- Time to play: 1-5 minutes

### Description

## Game Instructions
1. Place the target blinks across the space from you. 
2. If you CONNECT a buff blinks (green face), you get one or two free steps (depending on the number of steps you hit it with). _Example: if I double clicked and then connected with the buff blink, I now get two free steps._
3. You cannot go backwards. Only 5/6 faces require movement. 
4. 1 click of compass = 1 step. 2 clicks = 2 steps. 
5. Try to reach the target blinks. When you do, **connect the compass to the target.**
6. If you run into something you have to start over. 

### Setup
1. Begin with all the blinks not connected.
2. **Triple click one of the blinks** to designate it as the target. 
3. Place the target blink somewhere across the space if you are solo, or, designate someone to place the target blink somewhere. PLACE THIS BLINK VERTICALLY.

4. Single click one or two solo blinks. They will turn **green** place these in between you and the target somewhere. 

5. **Connect two blinks together** and **double click one of them** to activate its compass property.

This is how the blinks should be held. Click the blink on the bottom (one with red outline in this case)

6. Now, either single or double click the blink in your hand to determine which direction to take a step in. 1 click = 1 step. 2 clicks = 2 steps. 
7. **Long press the TARGET blink to reset its properties and startover. Or simply disconnect it and start over**

### Gameplay
1. Click or double click your compass and try to get to the target blink in as little time as possible. 

### Win Condition
The game is over when you reach the target blink and connect it to your compass. 

## Process
- Inspiration

Red Light Green Light. Journey. Trying to use blinks to capture a movement game. 

- Design Process

Started knowing I wanted to do something with movement. Thought of red light green light in my sleep and thought that would be a good concept to explore. This game can be played solo and have the player select how many steps they want to take however. 
Opted for a random direction each click because the RNG element adds uncertainty and excitement to every click. 

- Learning, Questions, Notes

I got close to eliminating the face of the blinks that points 180 degreess backwards. I now hide it if it is selected, but it still gets selected. So, if you click and select the 180 degree face, nothing will happen. It does feel weird like that but I do not know how to eliminate that face from random selection. I attempted by saving which face is selected and then having it select another random face, but that did not work.
