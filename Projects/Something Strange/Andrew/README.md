## DETAILS
Greetings Adventurer! Welcome to Jumanji! Wait...that's copyrighted? Welcome to Not-Jumanji! You see that glowing orb across the way? You must seize it! But alas, you've forgotten how to use your legs after that terrible plane crash. They still work, but you are so filled with PTSD from the crash that you cannot decide what way to walk. Fortunately, a magical compass has landed with you that will tell you which way to walk. Follow the compass, seize the orb, and you may just regain your senses. 

## Game Instructions
1. Place the target blinks across the space from you. 
2. Decide how many supplement blinks you want in between you and the target. You can have 0, 1, or 2. Single click the solo-blink to randomly assign it to BUFF (GREEN) or HAZARD (RED). ONLY CLICK ONCE. WHAT YOU GET IS WHAT YOU GET. By activating a supplement blink, you risk getting a buff or hazard. The choice is up to you if you want the risk. (_50/50 chance to get either red or green. possible to get 2 or none of each)_
3. If you CONNECT a buff blinks (green face), you get one or two free steps (depending on the number of steps you hit it with). _Example: if I double clicked and then connected with the buff blink, I now get two free steps._ If you connect a HAZARD blinks, you take 1-2 steps away from the target. 
4. You cannot go backwards. Only 5/6 faces require movement. 
5. 1 click of compass = 1 step. 2 clicks = 2 steps. 
6. Try to reach the target blinks. When you do, **connect the compass to the target.**
7. LONG PRESS ANY BLINK TO RESET IT.

1. Begin with all the blinks not connected.
2. **Triple click one of the blinks** to designate it as the target. 
3. Place the target blink somewhere across the space if you are solo, or, designate someone to place the target blink somewhere. PLACE THIS BLINK VERTICALLY.

4. Single click one or two solo blinks. They will turn **green** or **red**; place these in between you and the target somewhere. **They must be placed where it would be possible to hit them**. 
5. **Connect two blinks together** and **double click one of them** to activate its compass property.

This is how the blinks should be held. Click the blink on the bottom (one with red outline in this case)

6. Now, either single or double click the blink in your hand to determine which direction to take a step in. 1 click = 1 step. 2 clicks = 2 steps. 
7. **Long press the TARGET blink to reset its properties and startover. Or simply disconnect it and start over**

### Gameplay
1. Click or double click your compass and try to get to the target blink in as little time as possible. 
2. Utilize or be abused by the buff or hazard blinks. 

### Win Condition
The game is over when you reach the target blink and connect it to your compass. 

## Process
- Inspiration

Red Light Green Light. Journey. Trying to use blinks to capture a movement game. 

- Design Process

Started knowing I wanted to do something with movement. Thought of red light green light in my sleep and thought that would be a good concept to explore. This game can be played solo and have the player select how many steps they want to take however. 
Opted for a random direction each click because the RNG element adds uncertainty and excitement to every click. 
To add more player choice, I introduced the supplement blink mechanics. At the start of each round, it is up to the player to decide if they want to take the chance to get a huge advantage with a buff blinks. It is possible to get 2, 1, or 0 buff blinks in their attempts and the samme number of hazards. This prep phase leads to many trade offs that the player must consider. 

- Learning, Questions, Notes

I got close to eliminating the face of the blinks that points 180 degreess backwards. I now hide it if it is selected, but it still gets selected. So, if you click and select the 180 degree face, nothing will happen. It does feel weird like that but I do not know how to eliminate that face from random selection. I attempted by saving which face is selected and then having it select another random face, but that did not work.
