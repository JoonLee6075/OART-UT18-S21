# Project 2 - Star Catcher

Principle: 
- Core Mechanic
- Prototype of Core Mechanic

- Number of Players: 1
- Number of Blinks: 6-8

### Description
Try and catch a star

## Game Instructions
1. Arrange all blinks into a clump
2. Single click one blink to start
3. Try to “catch” the stars by clicking them
4. If you click incorrectly, there will be a red flash

## Process
- Inspiration: the game themes from both Porpentine and Jason Rohrer
- Learning, Questions, Notes: 
    the game is not something that you win or loose
    It will be impossible to “catch” the stars at first
    The more times you click on a blink incorrectly, the easier the game will become
    Once you are able to “catch” the stars, the game will get harder
