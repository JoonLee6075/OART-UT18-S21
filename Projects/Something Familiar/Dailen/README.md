# Project 1 - Color War

Rock, Paper, Scissors
- 2 Players
- Any number of blinks, so long as it's an even amount.
- A few minutes

It's Rock, Paper, Scissors, but with color instead of hands.

Secretly select a color by single-clicking, double-clicking, or multi-clicking, then place your blink against your opponents and see who wins.
Single-click for Yellow, which beats Magenta but loses to Blue.
Double-click for Blue, which beats Yellow but loses to Magenta.
Multi-click for Magenta, which beats Blue but loses to Yellow.

#### Setup
Collect your blinks. Each player should have the same amount.

#### Gameplay
Each player secretely picks their color, and when both players are ready, quickly connect their blinks and see who the stronger color is.
the player who set the stronger color, gets a point.

#### Win Condition
You need 5 points to win, though you could play one turn or infinite turns, it doesn't matter too much.
