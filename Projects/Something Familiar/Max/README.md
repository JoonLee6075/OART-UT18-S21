## Process

- Inspiration
my favorite game as a kid was tag. I wanted to incorporate the feeling of racing against something(in this case time)

- Design Process
I played heist a lot and spent a good amount of time looking at the source code
because I feel that I can use heist to build my game off of. I also looked at 
wham for randomizers and to keep track of when pieces can be interacted with.
