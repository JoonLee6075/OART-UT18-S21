# Project 1 - Find My Partner

Game Selected : Memory
- 1-2 Players
- 10 Blinks
- Play Time: 1+ mins

### Description

Objective:
Separate the blinks into corresponding color pairs before the time is up.

## Game Instructions

### Setup

1. To start, connect 10 blinks in a straight line.
2. To start the setup of the game, single click a blink at the beginning or end of the line. All of the blinks should then show 5 different colors.
3. Now, double click one of the blinks and wait for all of them to show a sparkle animation.
4. Once all of the blinks start sparkling, separate them, mix them up, and reconnect them in a clump.


### Gameplay
1. When you are ready to start the game, single click one of the blinks. A timer will now appear on all of the blinks.
2. When the timer stops, each blink will display one of 5 colors (pink, magenta, green, yellow or blue) for a period of 8 seconds.
3. In these 8 seconds, try to remember what color each of the blinks were.
4. When the timer is up, all of the blinks will turn white. When they are white, you will have 15 seconds to separate the blinks into pairs based on the color they originally displayed. 
5. Once the 15 seconds is up, and you have seperated the blinks into pairs, they will again display their original colors and you will be able to check to see if you correctly matched the pairs.
6. To restart the game, reconnect all of the blinks and double click one of them. The blinks will now sparkle again and you can repeat Setup step #3 and Game Play steps 1-6.
