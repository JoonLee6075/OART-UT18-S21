# Project 1 - Find My Partner

Game Selected : Memory
- 1-4 Players
- 10 Blinks
- Play Time: 1+ mins

### Description

Objective:
Separate the blinks into corresponding color pairs before the time is up.

## Game Instructions

### Setup

1. Connect 10 blinks in a straight line.
2. To start the setup of the game, single click a blink at the beginning or end of the line. All of the blinks should then show 5 different colors.
3. Now, rearrange the blinks so that they are in a clump.
4. Double click one of the blinks and wait for all of them to show a sparkle animation.

### Gameplay
1. When you are ready to start the game, single click one of the blinks. A timer will now appear on all of the blinks.
2. When the timer stops, each blink will display one of 5 colors (pink, purple, green, yellow or blue) for a period of 8 seconds.
3. In these 8 seconds, try to remember what color each of the blinks were.
4. When the timer is up, all of the blinks will turn white. When they are white, you will have 10 seconds to separate the blinks into pairs based on the color they originally displayed. 
5. These pairs of blinks should be connected to each other and separated from all other blinks.
6. If you have guessed the pairs correctly, all of the blinks will return to the sparkle animation and you can reconnect all of the blinks back into a clump and refollow steps 1-6.
7. If you have guessed incorrectly, the blinks will display red. In this case, to restart the game, reconnect the blinks and then double click one of them.
