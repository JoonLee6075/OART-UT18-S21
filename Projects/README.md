## Project 1 - Something Familiar
In this project, each student is interpretting an existing game, one from childhood and rethinking it to play as a digital tabletop game with Blinks. The goal is to retain an element or elements of the original game and think of the simple components of the original game's system.


## Project 2 - Something Strange
In this project, each student is designing a game or interactive experience with Blinks based on a thematic principle. Students research a game designer of their choice, and derive a principle they identify from their work that they would like to build around. This game will inherit its mechanics in support of this principle. This project should push the boundaries of what we think of as a game.
